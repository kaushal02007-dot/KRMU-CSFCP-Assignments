**Project Overview**

This repository contains my Assignment-3 submission and PPT covering Technologies, Use Cases and Career Opportunities for the Computer Science Fundamentals and Career Pathways course.
The objective of the assignment is to explore a technology domain, analyze its components, identify real-world use cases, and create a structured pathway report.
I selected Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as my focus domain due to its rapid growth, vast applications, and alignment with my academic and career goals.
